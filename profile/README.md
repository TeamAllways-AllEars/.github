Change of criteria for health insurance in 2009 expanded cochlear implant surgery and made more disabled children to study in inclusive education environment.<a href="https://www.e-asr.org/m/journal/view.php?number=498">[1]</a> Although many getting inclusive education, there aren't enough services for disabled children in South Korea.

**Team Allways** build solution for deaf children who need to engage in everyday communication in inclusive educational environment. We propose Real-Time Voice Volume Recommendation and Captioning with WearOS to make techology accessible and get accessorial ears for deaf children.
